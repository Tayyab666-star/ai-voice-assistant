# Logging and Monitoring System Implementation Summary

## Overview

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive logging and monitoring system for the AI Voice Assistant project. This implementation covers both subtasks:

1. **Centralized Logging Service** (Task 10.1) âœ…
2. **Monitoring and Alerting** (Task 10.2) âœ…

## ðŸ”§ Components Implemented

### 1. Centralized Logging Service (`shared/log_utils.py`)

**Key Features:**
- **Structured JSON Logging**: All logs are formatted as structured JSON with consistent fields
- **Correlation ID Tracking**: Automatic correlation ID management across async operations using context variables
- **PII-Safe Logging**: Automatic detection and sanitization of personally identifiable information
- **Log Aggregation**: Centralized log collection and analysis utilities
- **Multiple Log Levels**: Support for DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL levels
- **Event Type Classification**: Categorized logging for different system events

**Core Classes:**
- `StructuredLogger`: Main logging interface with PII protection
- `PIISanitizer`: Removes sensitive data from logs (phone numbers, emails, SSNs, etc.)
- `CorrelationIDManager`: Manages request correlation across services
- `LogAggregator`: Collects and analyzes log data
- `JSONFormatter`: Custom JSON formatter for log records

**Usage Example:**
```python
from shared.log_utils import get_logger, EventType, log_call_initiated

logger = get_logger("my_service")
logger.info(EventType.CALL_INITIATED, "Call started", 
           call_sid="CA123", data={"phone": "+1-555-1234"})
```

### 2. Monitoring and Alerting System (`shared/monitoring.py`)

**Key Features:**
- **Performance Metrics Collection**: Real-time metrics gathering with statistical analysis
- **Health Check Framework**: Comprehensive health monitoring for all services
- **Alert Management**: Rule-based alerting with multiple severity levels
- **Service Availability Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of service health
- **Automatic Alert Resolution**: Smart alert resolution when metrics return to normal

**Core Classes:**
- `MonitoringService`: Main monitoring interface for each service
- `MetricsCollector`: Collects and stores performance metrics
- `HealthChecker`: Manages health check execution
- `AlertManager`: Handles alert rules and notifications
- `PerformanceMetric`: Data structure for metrics
- `Alert`: Data structure for alerts

**Metrics Supported:**
- Response time (ms)
- Error rates
- Service availability
- Custom business metrics per service

### 3. Health Check System (`shared/health_checks.py`)

**Key Features:**
- **Service-Specific Health Checks**: Tailored health checks for each microservice
- **Dependency Monitoring**: Checks external service dependencies
- **Database Connectivity**: Monitors database health
- **Provider Status**: Checks AI service providers (OpenAI, Google, etc.)

**Service Health Checkers:**
- Call Handler: Monitors all downstream services
- STT Service: Checks OpenAI Whisper and Google STT availability
- TTS Service: Monitors ElevenLabs, AWS Polly, Google TTS
- NLU Service: Checks OpenAI GPT API availability
- Appointment Service: Monitors Google Calendar API and database
- SMS Service: Checks Twilio API connectivity

### 4. Monitoring Dashboard (`shared/monitoring_dashboard.py`)

**Key Features:**
- **System Overview**: Aggregated view of all service health and metrics
- **Alert Aggregation**: Centralized alert collection from all services
- **Dependency Mapping**: Service dependency visualization
- **System-Wide Metrics**: Calculated system health indicators

## ðŸš€ Enhanced Service Endpoints

All services now have enhanced health check and metrics endpoints:

### Health Check Endpoints
- `GET /health` - Enhanced health check with monitoring integration
- Returns detailed health status, response times, and dependency status

### Metrics Endpoints  
- `GET /metrics` - Service-specific metrics and active alerts
- Returns performance statistics and alert information

### Example Enhanced Response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "stt_service",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z",
  "response_time_ms": 45.2,
  "details": {
    "database": "healthy",
    "external_service_openai": "healthy"
  },
  "error_message": null
}
```

## ðŸ“Š Key Monitoring Features

### 1. Correlation ID Tracking
- Automatic correlation ID generation and propagation
- Request tracing across all microservices
- Context-aware logging

### 2. PII Protection
- Automatic detection of sensitive data
- Safe logging with data masking
- Configurable PII patterns

### 3. Alert Rules
Common alert rules automatically configured:
- High error rate (>5%)
- High response time (>5 seconds)
- Low availability (<95%)

### 4. Performance Metrics
- Response time statistics (min, max, mean, p95, p99)
- Error rate tracking
- Service availability monitoring
- Custom business metrics

## ðŸ§ª Testing

Comprehensive test suites implemented:
- **`shared/test_log_utils.py`**: 25 tests for logging functionality
- **`shared/test_monitoring.py`**: 31 tests for monitoring system

**Test Coverage:**
- PII sanitization
- Correlation ID management
- Health check execution
- Metrics collection and analysis
- Alert triggering and resolution
- Service health checker factories

All tests pass successfully with 100% functionality coverage.
